## First Assignment Grade Caculator
```
Grade Calc:
The @GradeCalc program was created to grab the users input for 5 major components of the CSC110 syllabus that make up the final grade. The program after verifying the users input successfully will calculate the amount of points earned in each of the 5 major components of the CSC110 syllabus and the final grade including the matching letter grade. After processing the user input, the program outputs the points for each component, the final grade, a letter grade, and a message that corresponds to the resulting letter grade.
