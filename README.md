## First Assignment Grade Caculator

Grade Calc:
The @GradeCalc program was created to grab the users input for 5 major components of the CSC110 syllabus that make up the final grade. The program after verifying the users input successfully will calculate the amount of points earned in each of the 5 major components of the CSC110 syllabus and the final grade including the matching letter grade. After processing the user input, the program outputs the points for each component, the final grade, a letter grade, and a message that corresponds to the resulting letter grade.

## Second Assignment Grade Caculator

Math Tutor:
This app is designed to create math problems based on The four basic arithmetic operations(+, - , X, /). This program makes up random questions for all 4 arithmetic operations and takes the user's answers  and if they are correct they are logged in the tutorLogCorrect.txt file and if they are wrong they are logged in the tutorLogWrong.txt file. The app also tells you the correct answers after you've answered wrong to a question. This application creates two txt files(tutorLogWrong.txt & tutorLogCorrect.txt) if they did not previously exist and append to them with every question answered. When you run the program the application, if files are available, will prompt you two different modes, review mode and normal mode, review mode goes through your tutorLogWrong.txt and asks you the questions in them again and tell you whether you got the correct or incorrect, but does NOT append to neither files. In normal mode you are asked randomly generated questions which depending on whether you answer correctly or incorrectly will append to the tutorLogWrong.txt file and tutorLogCorrect.txt respectively.
